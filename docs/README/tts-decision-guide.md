# TTS Decision Guide - Which Provider Should I Use?

Quick comparison to help you choose the right Text-To-Speech solution for your mission.

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Do you need voice communications?
│
├─ NO  → Skip TTS entirely (Hound works great with markers + text only!)
│
└─ YES → Use HoundTTS (default, recommended)
    │
    ├─ Want offline, zero-config voices?
    │   └─ Piper (bundled) or SAPI (Windows system voices)
    │
    ├─ Want premium cloud voices?
    │   └─ Google, Azure, AWS Polly, or ElevenLabs
    │
    └─ Already using STTS?
        └─ HoundTTS takes over transparently — no changes needed
```

**Bottom line: Use HoundTTS.** It's the default and recommended provider for Hound.

## Detailed Comparison

### HoundTTS ⭐ **DEFAULT & RECOMMENDED**

**✅ Pros:**

- **Default for Hound** — automatically detected and used when installed
- **Native C++ DLL** — no PowerShell overhead, no focus stealing, no visible windows
- **Fully parallel** — every TTS request is fire-and-forget in background threads
- **6 TTS providers** — Piper (offline, bundled), SAPI (Windows), Google Cloud, Azure, AWS Polly, ElevenLabs
- **Offline voices included** — Piper voices bundled, SAPI uses Windows system voices, no API key needed
- **Secure credentials** — API keys stored in INI file, never exposed in mission scripts or DCS logs
- **Auto-detects SRS** — reads SRS path from Windows registry, no manual configuration
- **Drop-in STTS replacement** — transparently takes over if STTS is also loaded

**❌ Cons:**

- **Windows only** — native DLL requires Windows 10 (1903+) or later
- **Cloud providers require API keys** — configured in `HoundTTS-credentials.ini`

**Best For:**

- **All Hound users** — this is the default and recommended choice
- New users getting started
- Users who want multiple voice provider options
- Offline/LAN missions (Piper or SAPI)
- Production missions needing reliable, parallel voice

**Setup Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Links:** [HoundTTS README](https://github.com/uriba107/HoundTTS)

---

### STTS (DCS-SimpleTextToSpeech) — Legacy Fallback

> **Note:** If HoundTTS is installed, it transparently takes over from STTS — **no configuration changes are needed**. Your existing STTS settings (`googleTTS`, Azure credentials, voice, gender, culture, speed, etc.) are automatically mapped to the corresponding HoundTTS providers. Just install HoundTTS and everything keeps working.

**✅ Pros:**

- **Widely used** — large community, well-known
- **Simple Lua script** — easy to understand
- **Windows TTS + Google Cloud** — two voice backends

**❌ Cons:**

- **PowerShell overhead** — spawns PowerShell processes, can steal focus
- **Fewer providers** — only Windows TTS and Google Cloud
- **Superseded by HoundTTS** — HoundTTS provides all STTS features and more

**Best For:**

- **Legacy missions** that haven't installed HoundTTS yet
- Fallback if HoundTTS is not installed

**Setup Time:** ~10-15 minutes  
**Links:** https://github.com/ciribob/DCS-SimpleTextToSpeech

---

### gRPC (DCS-gRPC) ⚠️ **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR HOUND**

**⚠️ Known Issues:**

- **Parallel transmission limitations** — problems when multiple radios transmit simultaneously (DCS gRPC project limitation)
- **Not ideal for Hound** — ATIS, Controller, and Notifier may conflict

**✅ Pros:**

- **Multiple backends** — Windows TTS, AWS, Azure, Google
- **Multi-tool integration** — works with Tacview, external apps

**❌ Cons:**

- **Parallel transmission issues** — main reason to avoid for Hound
- **Complex setup** — requires more technical knowledge

**Best For:**

- **Existing missions already using gRPC** — if you're already using it
- **Not recommended for new missions** — use HoundTTS instead

**Setup Time:** ~30-60 minutes  
**Links:** https://github.com/DCS-gRPC/rust-server

---

### No TTS (Map Markers + Text Only)

**✅ Pros:**

- **Zero setup** — works immediately
- **No dependencies** — nothing to install
- **No desanitization** — safer for multiplayer servers
- **Perfect reliability** — no voice issues possible

**❌ Cons:**

- **No voice** — must read F10 messages or markers
- **Less immersive** — no radio communications

**Best For:**

- Quick testing missions
- Multiplayer servers that forbid desanitization
- Users who prefer visual-only intelligence

**Setup Time:** 0 minutes

## Multiplayer Considerations

### HoundTTS

- **Server installs DLL once** — no per-mission Lua script loading
- **Clients need SRS** — standard requirement
- **Voice quality** — server-side provider config applies to all
- **Parallel transmissions** — native non-blocking, no conflicts

### STTS (Legacy)

- **Server must desanitize** — not all servers allow this
- **Clients need SRS** — standard requirement
- **Voice quality** — server-side TTS config applies to all
- **Compatibility** — widely supported

### gRPC

- **Server must desanitize** — same as STTS
- **Clients need SRS** — standard requirement
- **Server setup** — more complex for mission hosts

### No TTS

- **Server setup** — no special requirements
- **Client requirements** — none
- **Compatibility** — 100% compatible

**Verdict:** HoundTTS is the recommended multiplayer choice; No TTS is the most compatible

---

## Switching Providers

You can change TTS providers at any time by:

1. **Installing HoundTTS** — it automatically takes priority over STTS
2. **Setting provider priority:**
   ```lua
   HOUND.TTS_ENGINE = {'HoundTTS', 'STTS'}  -- Default
   HOUND.TTS_ENGINE = {'STTS'}               -- STTS only (legacy)
   HOUND.TTS_ENGINE = {'GRPC'}               -- gRPC only
   ```
3. **Changing HoundTTS provider** per-system:
   ```lua
   HoundBlue:enableController({freq = "251.000", provider = "piper"})
   HoundBlue:enableAtis({freq = "253.000", provider = "sapi"})
   ```

**Hound automatically detects available providers** — if your first choice isn't available, it falls back to the next.

## Recommendations by Scenario

### Solo Player, Immersion Focused

**→ HoundTTS with Azure, AWS Polly, or ElevenLabs**

- Best audio quality with cloud voices
- Piper for offline fallback

### Solo Player, Just Getting Started

**→ HoundTTS with Piper or SAPI**

- Easy setup, no API keys needed
- Upgrade to cloud providers later if desired

### Multiplayer Mission Builder

**→ HoundTTS with Piper or SAPI**

- Standard choice, easy for server hosts
- No PowerShell focus-stealing issues
- Good balance of quality and compatibility

### Competition/Training Server

**→ HoundTTS with cloud provider**

- Professional voice quality helps with clarity
- Consider cost if high usage

### LAN Party / Quick Mission

**→ No TTS or HoundTTS with Piper**

- No TTS: Zero setup
- HoundTTS + Piper: Quick setup, offline, no API keys

### Testing/Development

**→ No TTS**

- Fastest iteration
- Add voice in final mission

---

## Migration Guide

### From No TTS → HoundTTS

1. Copy HoundTTS files into DCS Saved Games folder
2. Add one line to `MissionScripting.lua`
3. (Optional) Copy config examples and edit
4. Add `enableController()` call
5. Test with SRS

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### From STTS → HoundTTS

1. Install HoundTTS (see above)
2. **Done** — HoundTTS automatically takes over from STTS, no changes needed

Your existing STTS settings (`googleTTS`, Azure credentials, voice, gender, culture, etc.) are automatically mapped to the corresponding HoundTTS providers. Everything keeps working as before.

We recommend eventually adopting the new `provider`-based configuration to access all HoundTTS features (Piper, AWS Polly, ElevenLabs, per-call provider selection).

**Time:** ~10 minutes (zero config changes required)

### From gRPC → HoundTTS

1. Install HoundTTS
2. Set `HOUND.TTS_ENGINE = {'HoundTTS'}` or let auto-detect
3. (Optional) Configure cloud providers in `HoundTTS-credentials.ini`
4. Restart mission

**Time:** ~10 minutes

### From No TTS → STTS (Legacy)

1. Install STTS
2. Desanitize `MissionScripting.lua`
3. Add STTS load in mission before Hound
4. Add `enableController()` call
5. Test with SRS

**Time:** 15-20 minutes

---

## Common Questions

### "Which provider sounds best?"

It depends on the HoundTTS backend you choose:

- **ElevenLabs** > **Azure/AWS Polly** > **Google Cloud** > **Piper** > **SAPI (Windows TTS)**
- Cloud voices cost money; Piper and SAPI are free and offline

### "Which is easiest to set up?"

**No TTS** > **HoundTTS** > **STTS** > **gRPC**

### "Which should I use for Hound?"

**HoundTTS** — it's the default. Native C++ DLL, fully parallel, 6 TTS providers, no PowerShell.

### "Why not gRPC?"

gRPC has known limitations with parallel transmissions in DCS, which causes issues when Hound's Controller, ATIS, and Notifier need to talk simultaneously.

### "I already use STTS — do I need to change anything?"

No. Install HoundTTS and it transparently takes over from STTS. Your existing configuration still works.

### "Can I use different providers for different systems?"

Yes! With HoundTTS you can set `provider` per-system:

```lua
HoundBlue:enableController({freq = "251.000", provider = "sapi", gender = "male"})
HoundBlue:enableAtis({freq = "253.000", provider = "piper", voice = "en_US-lessac-low"})
```

### "Do I need TTS?"

No! Hound's map markers and text system work excellently without voice.

### "Can I change mid-mission?"

No, TTS provider is determined at mission start. You can change frequencies or disable/enable systems.

## Bottom Line Recommendations

| Your Situation           | Recommended Provider                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **New to Hound**         | **HoundTTS** with Piper or SAPI                   |
| **New to DCS scripting** | No TTS first, add HoundTTS later                  |
| **Want best quality**    | **HoundTTS** with Azure, AWS Polly, or ElevenLabs |
| **Multiplayer mission**  | **HoundTTS** with Piper or SAPI                   |
| **Quick testing**        | No TTS                                            |
| **Already use STTS**     | Install HoundTTS — takes over automatically       |
| **Already use gRPC**     | **Switch to HoundTTS**                            |
| **Limited time**         | **HoundTTS** with Piper (zero-config voice)       |
| **Budget conscious**     | **HoundTTS** with Piper or SAPI (free)            |
| **Professional mission** | **HoundTTS** with AWS/Azure/ElevenLabs            |
| **Any Hound mission**    | **HoundTTS (always recommended)**                 |

**gRPC is NOT recommended for Hound** due to parallel transmission limitations.
