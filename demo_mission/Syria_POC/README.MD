### Additional Demo mission
while still suffering from some issues to be resolved, it shows Hounds ability to integrate into the current leading frameworks for DCS.  
based on [Pikey's Syria AD template](https://forums.eagle.ru/topic/243078-syrian-air-defence-network-2012-full-bonus-content) which includes [MOOSE](https://flightcontrol-master.github.io/MOOSE_DOCS/) and [Skynet IADS](https://github.com/walder/Skynet-IADS) in the mix.

I've added two C-130 off the coast of Lebanon and two stationary COMM towers on mt. Hermon and mt. Meron in Israel. Both added as platforms for the blue Hound system. I've also added an invincible MQ-9 in the Damascus area for you to tease the batteries with.
For each site Hound identified, a SEAD flight will be spawned. Enjoy the show!
